This project was inspired by Youtube channel "foo52ru" and author's study of swarm intelligence. 
There are small "agents"(aka ants) that have very simple set of rules to behave. When there is a lot of these agents, their behaviour becomes very interesting. 

**Controls**:
1 - Show agents(if hidden)<br/>
2 - Hide agents
Spacebar - change properties of all agents to random(aka restart simulation, but all agents will be in the same place)
LMB - add pheromone to cirlce around cursor
Q or red cross on the top of window - close simulatiom
