This project was inspired by Youtube channel "foo52ru" and author's study of swarm intelligence. <br/>
There are small "agents"(aka ants) that have very simple set of rules to behave. When there is a lot of these agents, their behaviour becomes very interesting. 

**Controls**:<br/>
1 - Show agents(if hidden)<br/>
2 - Hide agents<br/>
Spacebar - change properties of all agents to random(aka restart simulation, but all agents will be in the same place)<br/>
LMB - add pheromone to cirlce around cursor<br/>
Q or red cross on the top of window - close simulatiom<br/>
